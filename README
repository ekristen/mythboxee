MythBoxee
----------

Update 11 June 2010 - The application is now a python based application and it is being hosted in my custom repository for Boxee.

Repository: http://erikkristensen.com/project/boxeerepo

If you would like to beta test this for me please use the instructions below.

Installation
------------- 
1. Download the latest version of the MythBoxee php script. http://github.com/ekristen/mythboxee/raw/master/scripts/mythboxee.php
2. Upload the mythboxee.php script to your MythTV Backend server (this should be where the recordings are stored.)
3. Create a soft link to the recordings folder so that your recordings are accessible via http. (IE ln -s /path/to/recordings /DOCUMENT_ROOT/recordings)
4. Edit mythboxee.php, read the comments at the top of the file, update configuration variables as needed. Only one configuration variable needs to be changed for sure and that is the recordings variable.
5. Browse to the Apps section in Boxee
6. Select "Repositories" in the left hand side at the bottom.
7. Add Repository, use the url http://erikkristensen.com/project/boxeerepo
8. Launch MythBoxee, you'll be prompted to enter in the URL of where the mythboxee.php script is located. Make sure you include the http://
9. Sit back and enjoy watching your recordings from MythTV on your Boxee frontend.
 
ToDo
----
I am looking at potentially seeing if I can tie directly into the backend of MythTV so that I can take full advantage of commercial skipping and other MythTV features that are only accessible when streaming via the MythTV protocol.
