# START season name overrides section --------------------------------------------------------------
#####
# PURPOSE: TV program sources such as Schedule Direct series names do not always match the series
#          names on thetvdb.com. This section allow you to override series names to reduce the 
#          need for manual interaction and more accurate matching with thetvdb.com TV series wiki. 
#
# FORMAT:
# Any line starting with "#" is treated as a comment
# Any blank line is ignored
# All other lines must have two fields in this specific order:
# 1st) The series name or the %TITLE% field as passed by MythTV and a trailing ':' character
# 2nd) The thetvdb.com series id (SID) as specified for the series on thetvdb.com wiki. This will 
#       override the series name to eliminate the need for manual interaction.  
# NOTE: Included here. but disabled are examples of current (2009) TV shows that Schedule Direct
#       has different TV series names then what is on thetvdb.com wiki. If you are searching for 
#       series based on the Schedule Direct names as MythTV does then the wrong TV series will be
#       identified. You can pick the correct series by using interactive mode but this does not 
#       help with unattended processing. This section allows you to specify the correct TV series
#       on thetvbd.com despite the name in Schedule Direct. Luckily there are not many TV series
#       that require overrides.

# START episode name massaging section --------------------------------------------------------------
#####
# PURPOSE: TV program sources such as Schedule Direct episode names do not always match the episode
#          names on thetvdb.com. This section allow you to massage episode names to reduce the 
#          need for manual interaction and more accurate matching with thetvdb.com TV series wiki. 
#          Alter the episode names for a series to reduce the need for manual interaction
#          and more accurate matching with thetvdb.com TV series wiki. See example below.
#
# FORMAT:
# All lines must in the following format:
# 1st) The series name or the %TITLE% field as passed by MythTV and a trailing ':' character
# 2nd) Pairs of values separated by commas. The first value is the search text to match to text within
#      the episode name such as the %SUBTITLE% field passed by MythTV and the text to replace the 
#      matched searched text. If the replacement text contains a space then surround that text with
#      the '"' double quotation characters. 
#      E.g. "24": PM," PM", AM, " AM" will turn the episode name
#      "Day 7: 11:00AM to 12:00PM" into "Day 7: 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM"
#

# START regex section------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####
# NOTE: If you do not understand regex expressions DO NOT USE this section. 
# PURPOSE: This section adds regex strings used to parse video file names when extracting
#          the following: series name, season number, episode number. Essential when downloading 
#          metadata from mythtvfrontend->mythvideo when using ttvdb. You only need to add a regex
#          string if ttvdb cannot extract the required information from your video file names. 
# NOTE: ANY % percent sign in the expression must be doubled (e.g. a % must be changed to %% )
# NOTE: The key value (e.g. "regex##") must be unique for each value.
# NOTE: DO NOT surround the regex pattern string with the traditional ''' three single quotes
#       
# "regex01" is an example video file name "foo_S01_12" where:
# series name is "foo", season number starts at "S" and episode number starts after '_'
# foo_[s01]_[e01]
#####
[regex] 
# foo_S01_12
regex01: ^(.+?)[ \._\-][Ss]([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)[^\\/]*$
